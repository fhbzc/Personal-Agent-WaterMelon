<p align="center">
A desktop agent that learns what you are working on, on your own computer,
and helps with it: it keeps your tasks and calendar in view, tells you what
you need to know, and does pieces of work you hand to it, inside a sandbox
that can only write where you allow.

## What it does

**It learns what you are doing, not what you type.** It notices which
applications, documents and web pages you work with, only the sources you
leave switched on. Every 15 minutes it writes down, in a sentence or two,
what you were doing; every 12 hours it groups those notes into the tasks and
projects they belong to. What it learns is stored only on your computer, as
plain files you can open, and sent only to the model you choose
([Your privacy](#your-privacy)).

**An Overview of your work.** The task you are on now, your tasks and
projects as bars over time, a **To do** list you keep yourself, and a front
page of **what you need to know** today, drawn from your work and the people
around it.

**Calendar and notifications that learn from you.** It adds reminders it
thinks you need (an invitation in an email, a deadline in a document) and
says why each was worth interrupting you for. Every notification's buttons say
exactly what they do: *Got it*, *Remind me in N minutes*, *Add to to-do*, or
*Bad notification*. What you do with them, and only what *you* do, teaches it
which notifications to send next time.

**Delegate work.** Hand it a piece of work from wherever you are:

- right-click a folder, a file or the desktop → **Delegate work** (Windows;
  on Windows 11 it is under **Show more options**, or right-click with
  **Shift** held),
- select text in any window and click the small Watermelon button beside it,
- the avatar's menu, or the **Delegate work** button in To do.

A small **Delegate work** window opens, always in three steps:

1. **Your instruction.** What you handed over is shown, with a box for what
   you want done (or anything to add).
2. **Create.** It looks through its own records of your work for what is
   relevant, and drafts a short plan: the goal, the steps, what you will get,
   what is left out. You can change any of it.
3. **Start.** Nothing runs before you press it.

Two agents
then take turns, one doing the work and one reviewing it against how you
judge your own work. You see the run live, can pause or stop it, can go back
to any saved version, and get a `README.md` with the result saying what was
made and how to check it.

**Experience.** Ask it to *learn* a project and it writes down how the work
was broken into pieces and how each piece was judged. That is what the
reviewer uses when it works on that project for you.

**Connections.** The people in your work and what they are doing, from what
you had in front of you and from public pages only. It never signs in to
any of your accounts.

**Customized Recommendation.** Each day, things worth reading for your
current tasks and interests, chosen to tell you something you do not already
know. *More like this* and *Not interested* tune it.

**Chat.** Ask it about your work, or ask it to do something. Files it makes
in a conversation are kept in `workspace/Chat/<conversation title>/`.

**The Watermelon.** A small avatar on your desktop. It shows notifications in
a speech bubble, looks at your pointer, and turns to face the middle of the
screen. You can rename it, move it, or hide it.

**In your language.** English, 中文, Español, 日本語, 한국어, Русский, Français,
Deutsch and Italiano, chosen when you install and changeable in Settings. The
whole interface changes with it: every tab, menu, button and explanation, the
avatar's and the tray's menus, and the notifications' buttons. The agent
writes and speaks in it too.

## Your privacy

An agent that sees your work has to earn that. Personal Agent is built so
that your data is **stored only on your computer** and **sent only to the
model you choose**, never to any server of ours or anyone else's. **You
choose what it watches and what it does**, passwords and codes are
**filtered out before anything is kept or sent**, and **it cannot act
outside the limits you set**. All of this comes from how it is built, not
from a promise.

### Stored only on your computer

- **No account, no server of ours, no telemetry.** There is no service your
  data is uploaded to, and nothing is collected about you or about how you
  use it.
- **Everything it keeps is in one folder you own** (`PersonalizedAgent/`):
  what it learned as plain Markdown files in `workspace/data/` that you can
  open, edit or delete, and its database and settings in `internal/`. Delete
  the folder, and everything it ever kept is gone.
- **Raw activity is short-lived.** What the listener records is deleted after
  8 days; only the short notes made from it are kept.
- **Comparing and reading happen on your computer**: the embedding model that
  groups your notes runs locally, and pictures and scanned documents are read
  by your system's own OCR.

### Sent only to the model you choose

To understand your activity, the agent has to show it to a model: every 15
minutes, the text it read in that window of time is sent to **the model you
picked** to be summarised, and so are your chat messages and the files a
piece of work uses. That model is your choice, in **Settings → Models**:

- **A service you trust**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Mistral or
  any other you add, under its own privacy terms; or the Claude Code or Codex
  tool already signed in on your computer.
- **A model on your own machine** (Ollama, LM Studio, or anything with an
  OpenAI-compatible address): then your activity is never sent to a model
  service. **The only thing that still goes out is web searches**:
  Connections and Customized Recommendation look things up on the web on
  their own, with search words drawn from your current tasks and the people
  in them, so a search engine can see those topics. Turn those two off in
  Settings → Functions, and with a local model **nothing leaves your
  computer at all**.

Before anything is sent, the **smart filter** has already taken out
passwords, one-time codes and keys (see below).

### Exactly what leaves your computer

| What | Where to | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The text a step needs (a window of recent activity, your chat message, the files a piece of work uses), with passwords and codes already filtered out | **Only the model you chose**: nowhere, with a local model | When a step runs |
| Pictures | Only to a model that can see pictures | A model that reads text only gets the words, read locally |
| Web searches (the words come from your current tasks and the people in them) and the public pages they find | Brave Search (with your key) or DuckDuckGo, then the pages themselves, **with no cookies and no sign-in** | When Connections or Customized Recommendation run (turn them off and they stop), or when a piece of work you started needs the web |
| One-time downloads | Hugging Face (the embedding model, once), Google (the testing browser), PyPI (packages a piece of work needs) | Only the first time, or **only when you click Install / Approve** |

### You choose what it watches

**Settings → Privacy** has one switch per source, each saying what the agent
loses without it and what it costs your computer:

- the window in front (which program, which title),
- the text in that window,
- screenshots (the words in slides and pictures),
- your browser's history,
- files created and changed,
- coding assistants' sessions, and, separately, what was said in them.

Beyond the switches:

- **Windows it never reads**: password managers, private and incognito
  browsing, authenticators, banking and payment pages, by default, and any
  you add.
- **Folders it never watches**, and the agent's own folders are never
  watched at all, so its work is never mistaken for yours.
- **The smart filter for passwords, one-time codes and keys** takes them out
  of everything the listener records (screen text, window titles,
  addresses, assistant conversations, the words read off a picture) **before
  it is stored or sent to any model**. It finds them by their labels, in all
  nine languages, and by the shapes keys and tokens have, on your computer,
  so no password is ever shown to a model to ask whether it is one. The
  value becomes `[hidden]` and the label stays, so the agent still knows a
  sign-in happened, not what was typed. A screenshot showing one is not kept
  at all. On by default (*Hide passwords and codes*).

### You choose what it does

**Settings → Functions** lists what runs by itself, each with its own switch
and **what it cost over the last 72 hours**:

- **Task organisation**: grouping your notes into tasks and projects.
- **Calendar management**: notifications and reminders.
- **Connections**: the people in your work.
- **Customized Recommendation**: the daily reading.
- **Experience learning**: learning projects you choose.

Turn one off and it stops, along with its model calls. Only the core
(noting what you are doing) is always on, because everything else is built
on it. What you start yourself (chat, a piece of work) is counted apart.

### What it will never do

- **Sign in as you.** It never signs in to your accounts, never clicks
  anything in them, and never posts, sends or replies for you. What it knows
  about other people comes from what you had in front of you and from public
  pages.
- **Write anywhere you did not allow.** The agent writes only in its own
  workspace and in folders you add to a piece of work. This is enforced by
  code and, around every piece of code it runs, by the operating system's
  own sandbox (AppContainer on Windows, Seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on
  Linux). Your other files are read-only to it, and its own database and
  credentials are closed to it.
- **Start work by itself.** Every piece of work waits for your instruction
  and your approval of its plan.
- **Learn from itself.** Only what *you* do (a notification you call bad, an
  event or a person you delete, a story you are not interested in) changes
  what it learns about you.
- **Be reached by anything else.** Its page is served on `127.0.0.1` only,
  and answers only with this installation's key, so other programs and
  websites cannot read it.

### What you need

- Windows 10/11, macOS 11 or later (Apple Silicon), or Linux (x86-64).
- A model to think with: an API key for Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Google
  Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen, GLM, Mistral, OpenRouter or any
  OpenAI-compatible service, **or** the Claude Code or Codex command-line
  tool signed in on this computer. You add it in Settings → Models on first
  start. Several can be added in order; when one cannot answer, the next does.

## Install

Download from the **[latest release](https://github.com/fhbzc/Personal-Agent-WaterMelon/releases/latest)**:

| System | Installer (recommended) | Portable (no install) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** 10/11, x64 | [PersonalizedAgent-Setup-windows-x64.exe](https://github.com/fhbzc/Personal-Agent-WaterMelon/releases/latest/download/PersonalizedAgent-Setup-windows-x64.exe) | [PersonalizedAgent-portable-windows-x64.zip](https://github.com/fhbzc/Personal-Agent-WaterMelon/releases/latest/download/PersonalizedAgent-portable-windows-x64.zip) |

Every release also has **`SHA256SUMS.txt`**, the checksum of each file; see
[Check that a download is genuine](#check-that-a-download-is-genuine).

### Installer or portable?

They are the **same program**, built from the same commit by the same
workflow. Only how it gets onto your computer differs.

| | Installer | Portable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How | Run it. It asks for your language, installs, and adds a Start menu / Applications entry | Unzip anywhere and run `PersonalizedAgent` |
| Language, start at sign-in, Explorer's *Delegate work* entry | Set up by the installer | Set up by the program on its first start |
| Removing it | Uninstall from Settings → Apps (Windows) or the usual way; the extra entries go with it | Delete the folder. Turn off *Start at sign-in* in Settings first, or the entry stays |
| Best for | Most people | Trying it out, or keeping it on a USB drive |

Neither contains the developer **Debugger** tabs; see
[Build it from source](#build-it-from-source) if you want them.

### First start: the "unknown publisher" warning

The builds are **not code-signed**. Signing needs a paid certificate, and
this is a free, open-source project, so your system will warn once:

- **Windows.** SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"*. Click
  **More info → Run anyway**. Some antivirus programs are wary of unsigned
  Python applications; you can check the file as below.
- **macOS.** *"Personalized Agent can't be opened because Apple cannot check
  it."* Right-click the app (or the `.pkg`) → **Open** → **Open**, or allow it
  in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
- **Linux.** No warning. For the AppImage, `chmod +x` it first.

Nothing about the program depends on being signed. To know the file is the
one built from this code, check it.

---

## Check that a download is genuine

Two checks, the second stronger than the first.

**1. The checksum: is this the file that was published?** Compare your
download with `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same release:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-FileHash .\PersonalizedAgent-Setup-windows-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```
```bash
# macOS
shasum -a 256 PersonalizedAgent-macos.pkg
# Linux
sha256sum PersonalizedAgent-linux-x86_64.deb
# or check every file you downloaded at once
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS.txt
```

The value must match the line for that file exactly. (SHA-256, not MD5: MD5
can be forged, so a matching MD5 proves little.)

**2. The build attestation: was this file built from this source code?**
Every release file is built by GitHub Actions from the tagged commit, in the
open, and GitHub signs a statement of which commit and which workflow made
it. With the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
gh attestation verify PersonalizedAgent-Setup-windows-x64.exe --repo fhbzc/Personal-Agent-WaterMelon
```

It prints the commit the file was built from; open that commit on GitHub to
read the exact code. You can also read the build's log under the repository's
**Actions** tab.

> **Why not rebuild it and compare?** A build of a Python application with
> PyInstaller is not byte-for-byte reproducible (it records build times and
> paths), so a file you build yourself will have a different checksum even
> from identical code. The attestation is what ties the published file to the
> code.

---

## Using it

1. **Start it.** The Watermelon appears on your desktop and the app opens in
   your browser (an address on `127.0.0.1` only your computer can reach). The
   tray icon brings it back.
2. **Add a model.** Settings → Models → **Add**. Put the one you prefer
   first.
3. **Choose what it may notice.** Settings → Privacy. Each source (the window
   in front and its text, screenshots, browser history, files, coding
   assistants' sessions) can be switched off, each with what is lost without
   it and what it costs the computer. Passwords and one-time codes are hidden
   before anything is kept.
4. **Let it watch for a while.** After an hour or so the Overview shows what
   you were doing. Tasks and projects appear after the first grouping round.
5. **Hand it work.** Use any of the *Delegate work* entries. In the window
   that opens, say what you want and click **Create**; it collects the
   context and drafts a plan. Check the plan, change what you like, and click
   **Start**. Nothing runs before that. Without a folder, it works in
   `workspace/agent_work/<name of the work>/`. Follow it in the Experience
   tab.
6. **Tell it when it gets things wrong.** *Bad notification*, *Not
   interested*, deleting a person or an event: each is kept as a lesson, and
   only your own actions change what it learns.

Where things are (the defaults, changeable in Settings → General):

```
PersonalizedAgent/
├── workspace/          everything the agent makes, and the only place it may write
│   ├── agent_work/     work you delegated, one folder each
│   ├── Chat/           files made in chat, one folder per conversation
│   └── data/           what it learned: states, tasks, your nature, as plain files
└── internal/           its database, settings and logs; the agent cannot touch it
```

---

## Build it from source

You need Python 3.10 or later (3.12 recommended) and Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhbzc/Personal-Agent-WaterMelon.git
cd Personal-Agent-WaterMelon
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate     macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run it without building:**

```bash
python run.py
```

**Build the program and its installer:**

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
python build.py                    # with the Debugger tabs (a developer's build)
python build.py --no-debugger      # without them: the same as the released downloads
```

> **The Debugger.** The released installers and portable downloads are built
> **without** the Debugger: the panels that show every model call, token use,
> what each step was given, and test runners. A build from source **includes
> it unless you add `--no-debugger`**. It is a build-time choice, not a
> setting: a build without it does not contain the panels, the routes, or the
> code.

The result is in `dist/<platform>/`:

| Platform | What `build.py` makes | Also needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `PersonalizedAgent.exe` in a folder, a portable `.zip`, and `PersonalizedAgent-Setup.exe` | [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) for the installer |
| macOS | `Personalized Agent.app`, a `.dmg` and a `.pkg` | Xcode command-line tools |
| Linux | a folder, a `.tar.gz`, a `.deb` and an AppImage | `dpkg-deb`, `appimagetool` |

Other options: `--fast` (skip the tests and checks), `--no-installer`
(only the program folder), `--platform windows|macos|linux`.

**Run the tests:** `python scripts/run_tests.py`.

**Changed what a screen says?** Every text of the interface is in a fixed
table for each language (`personalized_agent/api/web/lang/`). Run
`python scripts/interface_words.py` to list what is missing, translate it into
every language, and merge it with `--merge`; a test fails until each table
has it.

---

## How it works

[**DESIGN.md**](DESIGN.md) is the map: the loops that observe, reflect,
group and act, what the agent keeps and where, how a delegated piece of work
runs, and how the sandbox holds. [`docs/design-doc.md`](docs/design-doc.md) is
the full design, with the reasoning behind each decision.
